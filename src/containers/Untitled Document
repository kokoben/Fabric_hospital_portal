- app occasionally carshes when selectin a restaurant. but can't single out the cause.
- often it's when it's the first restaurant in the list
- full descriptions don't show up in the dish detail view
- some dishes still using placeholder image.
- scoring systm not clear. he thought the star rating system and the health score were different ways for the user to rate the same thing.
- some dish items seem superfluous, like roasted almonds from cold stone
- app seems to ignore user's allergen information. he selected his allergens, but dishes that contain the allergen ingredients still populate the results.
- example: he selected tree nuts as an allergy, but roasted almonds, sliced almodns, and pecans still show up in coldstone.
- he selected seasame but still got sesame bagel from coffee bean and tea leaf.
- also ignores food preferences. he selected no chicken, beef, pork, or seafood, but still got back a chicken taco dish from rubios
- app doesn't save preferences on subsequent logins. have to reenter them.
